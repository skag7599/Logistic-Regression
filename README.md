# Logistic-Regression #


Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes).



Example used here

Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and
you want to determine each applicant's chance of admission based on their
results on two exams. You have historical data from previous applicants
that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training
example, you have the applicant's scores on two exams and the admissions
decision.
This project builds a classiffication model that estimates an applicant's
probability of admission based the scores from those two exams.
